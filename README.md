# mechanisms

On a Mac

1. mechanisms/Library/Mathematica/Applications/mechanisms.m should be installed into the corresponding directory of your Library folder. This is the main package and can be run stand alone with almost no loss of functionality.
2. the contents of mechanisms/Library/Mathematica/ApplicationData/mechanisms/ should be installed in the corresponding directory of your Library folder. These files contain some of the textures that can be used to prettify your origami images.

The .nb file contains the entire package with examples and some simple documentation.
